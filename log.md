### #daysofcode 20/7/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- SSL reading. My SiteGround hosting account will cover this for portfolio site.⁣
- Updating Project 1 so GitHub Pages uses the latest build version.⁣
- npm run build - understanding what React builds actually do to the files and folders.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Good to come back refreshed. Not had 2 days off without either having headache or hangover for 7 months.⁣
- #daysofcode means I continue my learning publicly but with less pressure and commitments. ⁣
- My knowledge of build systems and folders should help me get my Weather app up and running correctly now.⁣
- Build and static server working on fix branch but build folder seems to dissapear when I merge back to dev and master?! VSCode doesn't prompt for changes/deletions? Discovered git ignore was ignoring the build folder!⁣
- Master is running build ok but strange "<<<<<<< HEAD" appearing at the top? Updated few files - fixed.⁣
- GHP has updated deployment but still shows old version. I have 3x index.html files in the project (1 in build, public and static folders) - not sure what the diffs are and guessing GHP is using the wrong one.⁣
- Further understanding of package.json should help me here. ⁣
- I'm slowly untangling the mess but going forward with other projects, I'll know what to monitor as I go.⁣
- I think "Let me just get it working and worry about it later" from a few weeks back has caught up with me. All good.⁣
- GHP giving a 404 even though projects seems fine. I'm close. Now its a link and my read me displaying? Got it working using ghp branch.⁣
- Although I have spent 5.5 hours trying to solve the issue I have learned a lot about builds, serves and deployment.
